## Introduction

For elective-case patients, searching for a well-reviewed doctor fit for their specific medical needs is complicated. It often involves calling many offices and scheduling many time-consuming appointments. A system that allows users to search for and make appointments with doctors based on field of medicine, location, or patient reviews would improve this time spent. This project aims to make a database that contains this information in an accessible format for patients to use and for healthcare offices to update.
